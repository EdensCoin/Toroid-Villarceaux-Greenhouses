# Toroid-Villarceaux-Greenhouses
A Dome living space in the center, with a half-ring Toroid Greenhouse around the perimeter. Can be built / fabricated by robots using a scaffold that rotates around and traces a Villarceaux Circle to place &amp; weld a long ribbon of transparent material over the frame! making simple easy automated construction possible.
